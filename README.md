# space-website-source-code
This is the source code for a website built by me and my friends for a Hackathon conducted at our school. Please feel free to check it out if you would like some ideas on how to do such a project.
If you would like to visit the website, you can use the link emcdonalds.ml on any browser.
The assets folder holds all the images, CSS styles and prequesites required to run the website.
All the web-pages are stored as individual html files.
If you wish to run the code, download the file as a zip and host it using free hosters like replit or some other similar website hosting service.
Feel free to make any modifications and publish the modified websites as long as credit is given when it's due :)
Also would like to mention that this website won us a second place in our hackathon ;)

If you like the website, give us a rating on github, thanks in advance :D
